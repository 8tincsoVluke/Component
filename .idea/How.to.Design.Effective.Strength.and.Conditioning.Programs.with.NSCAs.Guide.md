One way to enhance your knowledge and skills in program design is to use NSCA's Guide To Program Design as a reference. This book, developed by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), offers the most current information, guidance, and protocols from respected scientists and practitioners with expertise in strength and conditioning program design. It covers all the key aspects of program design, from athlete needs assessment and performance testing, to dynamic warm-up and static stretching, to resistance, power, anaerobic, endurance, agility, speed, and balance and stability training. It also explains how to integrate and periodize these components into a cohesive annual training plan.
 
NSCA's Guide To Program Design is part of the Science of Strength and Conditioning series, which provides the guidelines for converting scientific research into practical application. It is an authoritative text that moves beyond the simple template presentation of program design to help you grasp the reasons and procedures for sequencing training in a safe, sport-specific manner. It also includes 20 tables that are sample workouts or training plans for athletes in a variety of sports, technique photos and instructions for select drills, and extensive references for further study and professional enrichment.
 
Whether you are a practicing professional or a new professional preparing for certification, NSCA's Guide To Program Design is a valuable resource that will help you design effective strength and conditioning programs for your athletes and clients.

But what are the benefits of strength training for your health and fitness? Why should you include it in your routine? Here are some of the main reasons why strength training is good for you:
 
- It increases muscle strength. Strength training helps you develop stronger muscles that can perform various tasks more efficiently. This can improve your performance in sports, work, and daily activities ( 2 ).
- It increases muscle endurance. Strength training helps you improve your muscular endurance, which is your ability to sustain exercise for a period of time. This can help you avoid fatigue and perform better in endurance sports, such as running, cycling, or swimming ( 2 ).
- It reduces body fat. Strength training helps you burn calories during and after your workout, which can help you lose excess body fat and maintain a healthy weight. It also increases your muscle mass, which boosts your metabolism and helps you burn more calories at rest ( 2 ).
- It develops strong bones. Strength training puts stress on your bones, which stimulates them to grow denser and stronger. This can reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition that causes your bones to become weak and brittle ( 3 ).
- It enhances your quality of life. Strength training can improve your physical and mental well-being in many ways. It can boost your mood, confidence, self-esteem, and body image. It can also reduce your stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. It can help you maintain your independence and functionality as you age by improving your balance, coordination, mobility, and stability ( 3 ).
- It manages chronic conditions. Strength training can help you prevent or manage various chronic conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. It can also improve your blood sugar control, blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and inflammation ( 3 ).

As you can see, strength training has many benefits for your health and fitness. But how can you get started with it? How can you design effective programs that suit your needs and goals?
