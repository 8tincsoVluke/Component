# How to Download and Install OpenGL 2.0 on Windows 8 64-bit
  
OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that allows developers to create applications with high-performance 2D and 3D graphics. OpenGL is widely used in the gaming industry, as well as in computer-aided design (CAD), simulation, virtual reality, and scientific visualization.

If you want to run OpenGL applications on your Windows 8 64-bit system, you need to have a compatible graphics card and driver that support OpenGL 2.0 or higher. In this article, we will show you how to download and install OpenGL 2.0 on Windows 8 64-bit using NVIDIA's driver.
  
## Step 1: Check Your Graphics Card Model and Driver Version
  
Before you download and install OpenGL 2.0, you need to make sure that your graphics card model and driver version support OpenGL 2.0 or higher. To do this, follow these steps:
  
- Right-click on the desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel**.
- In the left pane, click on **System Information**.
- In the right pane, look for the **OpenGL Version** field. If it says **2.0** or higher, you already have OpenGL 2.0 installed and you can skip to Step 3. If it says **1.x**, you need to update your driver to get OpenGL 2.0.
- Also, look for the **Driver Version** field. Note down the number for future reference.

## Step 2: Download and Install NVIDIA's OpenGL Driver
  
If you need to update your driver to get OpenGL 2.0, you can download and install NVIDIA's OpenGL driver from their website. To do this, follow these steps:

- Go to [https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver).
- Under **Release Driver Downloads**, find the section for **Windows**.
- Select the link for **Windows 8 and 7 (64-bit)**. This will download a file named **442.19-desktop-win8-win7-64bit-international-whql.exe**.
- Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install the driver.
- Restart your computer when prompted.

## Step 3: Verify That OpenGL 2.0 Is Installed
  
After installing the driver, you can verify that OpenGL 2.0 is installed by repeating Step 1. You should see that the **OpenGL Version** field now says **2.0** or higher.
  
Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed OpenGL 2.0 on Windows 8 64-bit using NVIDIA's driver. You can now run OpenGL applications that require OpenGL 2.0 or higher on your system.
  
## What Is OpenGL 2.0 and What Are Its Features?
  
OpenGL 2.0 is a major update to the OpenGL specification that was released in 2004. It introduced several new features and enhancements to the graphics API, such as:

- **Shaders**: OpenGL 2.0 introduced programmable shaders, which are small programs that run on the GPU and can perform custom calculations on vertices and fragments (pixels). Shaders allow developers to create more realistic and dynamic effects, such as lighting, shadows, reflections, and post-processing.
- **GLSL**: OpenGL 2.0 also introduced the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), which is a high-level language for writing shaders. GLSL is based on C syntax and supports common data types, operators, control structures, and built-in functions. GLSL also provides access to various OpenGL state variables and constants.
- **Multiple Render Targets**: OpenGL 2.0 allows developers to render to multiple color buffers at once, which can be useful for implementing techniques such as deferred shading, shadow mapping, and HDR rendering.
- **Non-Power-Of-Two Textures**: OpenGL 2.0 supports textures that have dimensions that are not powers of two, such as 300x200 or 512x768. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance by avoiding texture padding and scaling.
- **Point Sprites**: OpenGL 2.0 supports point sprites, which are points that are rendered as textured quads. Point sprites can be used to create particle effects, such as fire, smoke, sparks, and rain.
- **Occlusion Queries**: OpenGL 2.0 supports occlusion queries, which are queries that can determine how many pixels of an object are visible on the screen. Occlusion queries can be used to optimize rendering by culling objects that are hidden by other objects.

## How to Use OpenGL 2.0 Features in Your Applications?
  
To use OpenGL 2.0 features in your applications, you need to have a compatible graphics card and driver that support OpenGL 2.0 or higher, as well as an appropriate development environment and tools. Here are some steps you can follow to get started:

- Download and install the latest version of the [NVIDIA OpenGL driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver) for Windows 8 64-bit from their website.
- Download and install a development environment that supports OpenGL development, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/).
- Download and install an OpenGL library that provides bindings for your programming language of choice, such as [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), or [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).
- Download and install a GLSL compiler that can compile your shader source code into binary code that can be loaded by OpenGL, such as [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang), [glsl-optimizer](https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer), or [Shader Minifier](https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier).
- Create a window and an OpenGL context using your chosen library.
- Load and compile your shader source code using your chosen compiler.
- Create and bind shader objects and program objects using OpenGL functions.
- Set up your vertex data, texture data, uniform variables, and render targets using OpenGL functions.
- Render your scene using OpenGL functions.
- Clean up your resources and close your window using your chosen library.
