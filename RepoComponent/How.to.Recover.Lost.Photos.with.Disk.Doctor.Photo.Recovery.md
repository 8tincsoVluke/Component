### Tips:
 
- Do not use your drive or device from where you have lost data to avoid any writing process on it. This ensures that deleted or lost data is intact and is still recoverable.
- If you are recovering data from a memory card or a removable device, make sure it is properly connected and detected by your computer before launching the software.
- If you are recovering data from a drive with bad sectors, you can create a disk image of it using the software and then recover data from the disk image. This will avoid further damage to your drive and improve the chances of recovery.
- You can use the "Save Recovery Session" feature to save the recovery information and access it later to resume the recovery process.
- You can try the free trial version of the software before buying it. The trial version allows you to scan and preview the recoverable files but not save them. To save them, you need to buy a license key for $49[^2^].
